Welcome to Shane's Portfolio!

I have the following example files that would prove my experience in some certain areas:
(The files are not gigantic projects, but merely an example of what I have learned and what I am capable of doing)

C: 
HoopsStats.c

Java: 
Ograph.java

Digital Systems Design: 
CPU.circ
Note that Logisim or iVerilog is required to view a circ file. 
The CPU does not have pipelining. 

SSD & IC Electronics Design: 
MOSFET Astable Multivibrator.brd
MOSFET Astable Multivibrator.jpg
MOSFET Astable Multivibrator Image.png
Note that EagleCAD or Cadence Allegro is required to view a brd file.
